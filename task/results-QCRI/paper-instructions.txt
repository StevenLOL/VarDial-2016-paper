Participants of the shared task are strongly encouraged to submit a system description paper outlining their approach.

Submitted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings and indexed in the ACL Anthology.

Your results package includes an automatically generated Latex paper template which includes your results. This can be a very good starting point to writing your paper. A bib file with relevant references is also included.

You can submit your paper here:

Here are some additional tips to help you write your system description paper.

- Please refer to the 2016 shared task report and the 2014 DSLCC dataset paper that describes the data used in the task. 

- We will cite the system papers in the shared task report. Please avoid changing your paper title and author names/order after submission.

- We strongly encourage you to submit a paper, even if your system did not perform very well. We can also learn from approaches that were not so successful.

- Give your paper a descriptive title, possibly mentioning your methodology/approach. You don't need to include your team's name in the title.

- We recommend that you check previous years' system papers and shared task reports. You might find useful information to write your paper.
